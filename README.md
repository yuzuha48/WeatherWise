# WeatherWise ☀️

WeatherWise provides a four-day forecast for Minneapolis, Honolulu, New York, and Tokyo, cities chosen due to their personal significance in my life. 

In this project I:

- Integrated an API request to Open Weather Map to retrieve a four-day weather forecast for multiple locations
- Leveraged JavaScript to improve UI by changing images, descriptions, and temperatures to reflect the appropriate weather conditions and enabling seamless conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius 
- Developed an adaptable front-end design using HTML and CSS

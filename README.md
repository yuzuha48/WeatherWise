# WanderGuide ✈️

Since I love traveling, I decided to create a travel itinerary sharing social media platform where people can create and view itineraries for various places! 

Users can:
- 🔍 search for itineraries based on location
- ➕ add as many days to their itineraries as they wish
- 📍 pin locations on Google Maps in their itineraries
- ♥️ save other users' itineraries
- 👀 view how many people saved the itineraries
- ✏️ edit & delete itineraries they created
